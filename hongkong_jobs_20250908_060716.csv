We aren't a bank or a traditional fund; we are a collective of brilliant and driven engineers, researchers, and traders who build everything from the ground up.  

Our competitive edge is our code. We engineer ultra\-low\-latency, high\-throughput systems that trade across global markets 24/7\. We've built a culture where intellectual curiosity thrives, the best ideas win, and a passion for solving incredibly complex problems is what gets us out of bed in the morning. Our team is young, international, and built on a foundation of mutual respect and a shared obsession with technical excellence. **The Opportunity**  

This isn't just another coding job. It's a chance to join an elite team that builds the high\-performance systems powering our global trading operations. We're searching for a Senior Developer who is obsessed with elegant solutions, clean code, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with technology.  

You'll be working in a 100% hands\-on role where you own your projects from end\-to\-end. This is a position with a direct and achievable path to leadership; perform well, and you could soon be building and leading your own team of engineers.

* Mentor and elevate junior engineers, fostering a culture of technical excellence and continuous knowledge sharing.

### **What You Will Need**

* You have 5\+ years of professional software development experience, with a solid grounding in a **Linux** environment.
* You hold a university degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering, or a related discipline.
* You craft beautiful, maintainable code. While we're heavily invested in Rust and C\#, your deep expertise in any modern object\-oriented language (**Java, C\+\+**, etc.) is highly valued. If you have the right engineering fundamentals, we'll help you master Rust.
* The world of financial markets, low\-latency systems, and blockchain technology genuinely excites you.
* You take immense pride in your work, owning every aspect of your deliverables from design to deployment.
* You have a deep\-seated passion for dissecting complex problems and engineering elegant, efficient solutions.
